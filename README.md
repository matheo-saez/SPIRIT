#### Dimensions

Chassis: ?

PCB: 80mm x 150mm

Total: thickness is ~12.3mm (excluding camera module lens sticking out)

Main components that contribute thickness:

#### Camera

SPIRIT is compatible with [Arducam](https://www.arducam.com/) cameras e.g. the [64 MP Hawkeye](https://www.arducam.com/64mp-ultra-high-res-camera-raspberry-pi/) or the more affordable [16 MP Autofocus](https://www.arducam.com/16mp-autofocus-camera-for-raspberry-pi/).

The camera module can be completely powered off by the user using a physical switch.

Below are the stats for the Hawkeye:

| Name    | Sensor Resolution  | Zoom | Field Of View |
|---------|-----------------|-----|---------------|
|Pi Hawk-eye| 64MP (9152 x 6944 pixels) |  10x (digital) | 84 degrees |

For more details see the [product page](https://www.arducam.com/64mp-ultra-high-res-camera-raspberry-pi/)

*(For now there is only one camera for simplicity and cost reduction)*

# Hardware And Electronics

### Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5

"The power of Raspberry Pi 5 in a compact form factor for deeply embedded applications" [(CM5 website)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-5/?variant=cm5-104032).

By default SPIRIT uses the 4GB RAM, 64GB eMMC version of the CM. It is possible to use a different CM5 variant (for example to increase the RAM to 8GB).

### EDA

For schematics, PCB layout etc. the newest major release of KiCad is used.

All EDA files are available through this repository (see the 'EDA-kicad' folder). The best way to view them is to clone the repo to your machine and use KiCad to open the project file 'cm5-carrier.kicad_pro'.

### Carrier PCB

Custom carrier board (motherboard) that interfaces between the Compute Module and the rest of the electronics.

This is the only custom electronic component in this project.

### Touchscreen

Capacitive LCD Display TFT MIPI 
Dimensions: 5.5" (139.70mm) 1280px x 720px

### Replaceable Battery

Can be completely disconnected by the user using a physical switch.

The battery is mounted such that it can be easily uninstalled for replacing or privacy reasons. The user is free to swap the battery for any compatible model.
It is also possible to run the phone without a battery, or using an external one
if you attach long enough wires.

An added benefit is that the user can easily replace an empty battery for a charged one - effectively eliminating the need to wait for the phone to charge. An external battery charger can also be used for unmounted batteries.

### GSM, GPS Module

EC25VFA-512-STD

Can be completely powered off by the user using a physical switch.
Cellular, Navigation BeiDou, EDGE, Galileo, GLONASS, GPS, GNSS, LTE Transceiver Module 1.561GHz, 1.575GHz, 1.602GHz

### Speakers

2 x CMR-15062S-67

The speaker system consists of a pair of speakers mounted symmetrically facing upwards.

### Biometric Module

100018754

The fingerprint scanner is located on the back of the phone and has a sensing
area of 8x8mm. It is rated for 10 million finger placements and can store up to
50 templates.

False acceptance rate: 1/500k (per finger)
False rejection rate: 1.4-3.5 %

### Headphone Jack

This phone has a TRRS headphone jack. This way the user can decide between wireless or wired.

### Microphone

SPH0645LM4H-B

Can be completely powered off by the user using a physical switch.
Omnidirectional with a theorethical frequency range 20 Hz - 10 kHz.
Sensitivity: -26dB ±3dB @ 94dB SPL.
Digital output (I2S)

### Buttons

The power, volume and programmable buttons are identical rectangular, tactile switches with a life
expectancy of 30k cycles.

The Programmable Button's function can be customized by the user. For example, it can be used for quick launching an app, instantly dialing a saved contact, toggling sound settings (silent, vibrate, sound) etc. The list of potential use cases is very long. One of them could be enabling small children or elderly people to instantly call for example a parent, or supervisor in case of emergency. Another could be to immediately launch the camera app to quickly capture a moment.

### Privacy Switches

SPIRIT has 4 physical switches that cut off the power lines to specific modules
ensuring they are 100% inactive and not drawing power. Notice, you can also
completely disconnect the battery. Needless to say, this is a very useful
feature for people who want to have direct control over the hardware and want to
protect their privacy without having to trust software.

| Switch Number | Module |
|----------------|-----------|
| 1| Microphone|
| 2|GPS/GSM EC25 chip |
| 3|Camera |
| 4|Battery |

### Flashlight

LXML-PWC1-0100

1W 3V white, cool LED.

Toggling on/off can be binded to the programmable button.

# Software And Operating System

Once the hardware platform is functional it will be time to test various operating
systems as well as explore the possibility of developing one based on Debian.

List of operating systems to test/research:

| Name           | Website |
|----------------|-----------|
| Ubuntu Touch   | https://ubuntu-touch.io/     |
| Lineage        | https://lineageos.org/    |
| Graphene       | https://grapheneos.org/features      |
| Android        | https://www.android.com/      |

Additionally, The Yocto Project has been suggested (not an OS) https://www.yoctoproject.org/

# DIY Build Guide

Link to build guide/tutorial: COMING SOON!!!

# Parts List

The list is incomplete and old, it will be updated as soon as we have built the 1st prototype

To get the most up-to-date parts list please look
at the BOM. Certain components such as the camera or the compute module can be swapped for a different
model - the presented setup is just a suggestion.

# Ethical And Environmental Concerns

SPIRIT phones avoid components produced in unfair or harmful ways, as well as
containing conflict minerals if possible.

TODO
Here are ethical details for each major component:

-Chassis
-CM5
-Battery
-Screen
-Chassis
-Speakers

The goal is to be 100% ethically and environmentally "clean" as soon as possible, however that is
a hard task and presents multiple enginnering challenges.
